I am a 5th year PhD student in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at JHU](https://pbs.jhu.edu/) supervised by [Dr. Christopher Honey](http://www.honeylab.org/). Before coming to JHU, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, and worked in National Taiwan University Hospital doing research in clinical neuroscience.

My PhD research focuses on understanding how the human brain processes real-world sequences such as videos and speech. As a researcher in computational neuroscience, I analyze neuroimaigng (e.g. fMRI) data to explore the neural phenomena of sequence processing, and build computational models including machine learning tools to investigate the computational mechanisms underlying the neural phenomena of sequence processing. Besides the brain, I am also interested in analyzing the representation learned by the recurrent neural langauge models, to understand the similarity/difference between brains and machines.
