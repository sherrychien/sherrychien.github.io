I am a 4th year PhD student in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at JHU](https://pbs.jhu.edu/) supervised by [Dr. Christopher Honey](http://www.honeylab.org/). Before coming to JHU, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, and worked in National Taiwan University Hospital doing research in clinical neuroscience.

My research focuses on uncovering the computational principles for real-world sequence processing and learning in human brain and mind, including natural language processing. My work is best described as computational cognitive neuroscience, as I apply machine learning and computational modeling tools to human behavioral and neuroimaging data, and develop brain-inspired model architecture by adapting findings in neuroscience and cognitive science. My goal is to bridge cognitive neuroscience and AI to create human-like machines.
